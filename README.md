# Course-Registration-System
An object-oriented Java implementation of a cuniversity Course Registration System (CRS) for the use of school’s administration that deals with student registration and all students registered in courses.

--- Course Management ---
1. Create a new course
2. Delete a course
3. Edit a course (this will allow the admin to edit any information on the course except for course ID and name)
4. Display information for a given course (by course ID)
5. Register a student (this option will allow the admin to add a student without assigning to a course check Req 11 for student’s information – Hint: You might need to have an ArrayList of Students where you store Student objects)
6. Exit

--- Reports --- 
1. View all courses (for every course the admin should be able to see the list of enrolled student’s names, enrolled student’s ids, number of students registered, and the maximum number of students allowed to be registered)
2. View all courses that are FULL (reached the maximum number of students)
3. Write to a file the list of course that are full
4. View the names of the students that are registered in a specific course
5. View the list of courses that a given student is registered in (given a student first name and last name the system shall display all the courses that student is registered in)
6. Sort the courses based on the current number of students registered 7. Exit
